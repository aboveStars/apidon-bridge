Image Classification API
-This project provides a RESTful API service for image classification using a pre-trained neural network model with FastAPI.

    1-Features
        -Predict image class from a supplied image URL.
        -Utilize a pre-trained Keras model for prediction.
        -Enable CORS for cross-origin AJAX requests.
        -Run the service using Docker for easy deployment and isolation.

    2-Requirements
        -Python 3.11.8 is required. All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt for easy installation.

    3-Installation
        -To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
            -pip install -r requirements.txt

    4-Usage
        -Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the FastAPI server locally using:
            -uvicorn main.classify:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
        -The server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

    5-Endpoints
        -GET /: Returns a welcome message.
        -POST /classify: Accepts a JSON object with an image_url field and returns image classification results.
        
    A- Request Format
        -To classify an image, send a POST request to /classify with a JSON body like the following:

            json
            {
              "image_url": "http://example.com/image.jpg"
            }

    B- Response Format
        -The API will return a JSON response containing the image classification predictions. For example:

            json
            {
              "predictions": [
                {
                  "class_name": "Apple",
                  "probability": "95.47%"
                },
                ...
              ]
            }

    6-Docker
        -A Dockerfile is provided to build and run the service in a Docker container.

            -To build the container image, use:

                docker build -t image_classification_api .

            -To run the service in a container, execute:

                docker run -p 8000:8000 image_classification_api
    7-Note:
            -Be sure to include any necessary information for setting up and running the application, as well as any configuration details specific to your implementation. 
            -If there are any additional steps required to train or update the model being used for image classification, include those details as well for complete documentation.
